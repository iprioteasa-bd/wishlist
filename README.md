## ðŸš€ Real-Time Features

### **How Real-Time Sync Works**
1. **Firebase Firestore**: Uses Firebase as the backend database
2. **Real-Time Listeners**: Changes appear instantly across all devices
3. **Automatic Sync**: No manual refresh needed
4. **Offline Support**: Works offline and syncs when connection is restored
5. **ðŸ†• Zero Configuration**: Works automatically without any setup!

### **Benefits**
- âœ… **Real-Time**: See changes from other users instantly
- âœ… **Reliable**: Firebase's infrastructure ensures uptime
- âœ… **Scalable**: Handles multiple users seamlessly
- âœ… **Secure**: Firebase handles authentication and security
- âœ… **Offline**: Works even without internet connection

## Setup Instructions

### **1. Firebase Setup**
1. Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Enable Firestore Database
3. Update `src/app/config/firebase.config.ts` with your Firebase config
4. Set up Firestore security rules (test mode for development)

### **2. Deploy to GitHub Pages**
1. Create a public repository named `wishlist`
2. Push your code to the main branch
3. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
4. Your app will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io/wishlist/`

## Data Storage

### **Firebase Firestore (Primary)**
- Real-time database with automatic synchronization
- Changes appear instantly across all devices
- Handles offline scenarios gracefully
- Secure and scalable

### **Local Storage (Backup)**
- User edits are automatically saved in the browser's localStorage
- Data persists across browser sessions
- Each user has their own separate storage
- Used as fallback when Firebase is unavailable
